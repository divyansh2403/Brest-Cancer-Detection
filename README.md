# ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.  
It demonstrates a complete ML pipeline â€” from **data preprocessing** to **model training**, **evaluation**, and **deployment** using Flask / Streamlit.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide.  
Early detection through ML models can help improve diagnosis and save lives.

This project includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Feature scaling and cleaning  
- Model training (Logistic Regression / Random Forest / SVM)  
- Evaluation metrics  
- Web API or UI for predictions

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- **Python 3.10+**
- **pandas**, **numpy**, **scikit-learn**
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn**
- **Flask** or **Streamlit** for deployment
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** for development
